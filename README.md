# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni Vici*

Submitted by: **Maggie Killada**

This web app: **Search images taken by the Curiosity Rover on Mars.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

The NASA API that I used for this project requires you to use at least one parameter to retrieve the data. I used Sol, which was one of my attributes, so it was difficult trying to figure out how to display an image randomly if the data retrieved was already queried.
